# Diploma Final Year Project
2D beat'em up party game

Ambitious. Initially started as only a party game, but added single player story later down.
The project could be better in more capable hands. Who's to blame, could be me after all.
After many years, I do think it would had been a fun game.

As of this I am officially burnt out.
